binary search is a search algorithm that works only on ordered arrays.

to apply it:

define two pointers: initial (start of the array) and end (end of the array).

calculate the middle index: middle = (initial + end) // 2.

compare the reference value with the middle element:

If equal, the value is found.
If smaller, search in the left half.
If larger, search in the right half.

repeat until the value is found or initial > end (value not in the array).

example:
array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], searching for 5:

middle = 2, value found at index 2.
