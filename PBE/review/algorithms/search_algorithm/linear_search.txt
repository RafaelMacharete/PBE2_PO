linear search is a search algorithm that works by taking a reference value. 
then, you compare each element in an array
if the reference value equals an element in the array, you have found it. Otherwise, it is not present.

example:

true condition:
    reference value: 1
    array: [2, 6, 1, 7, 4, 11]
    The algorithm finds 1 in the array.
    
false condition:
    Reference value: 0
    Array: [2, 6, 1, 7, 4, 11]
    The algorithm does not find 0 in the array.
