Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm
it works by taking the first element as a reference value and comparing it with the next elements,
switch them if they are in the wrong order

example:
3, 1, 5, 2

First reference value: 3
Compare 3 with the other values:

Compare 3 and 1 → switch → 1, 3, 5, 2
Compare 3 and 5 → no switch → 1, 3, 5, 2
Compare 5 and 2 → switch → 1, 3, 2, 5
